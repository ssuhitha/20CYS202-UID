<h4><mark style="background-color:A7BC5B;">My High-School experience</h4>
<p> During my high school experience, I went through a ton of stress trying to figure out my path to educational success. I was a decently good student with grades consisting of C’s to A’s. Dealing with problems in high school made me realize what I should had done to obtain a proper education.When people start high school they’re usually so excited. They can’t wait to experience everything that comes with being in high school, I mean who wouldn’t? Everyone says that high school is the best four years of your life.  Now that I’m months away from graduating, I can’t say they were my best years but I can say they were my most educational years, of course I wouldn’t say that they weren’t fun because they were. When I say educational, I mean I’ve learned so much about myself and so much about life. I learned what the words family, love, betrayal, law and life meant.  All these events changed me, and I’m glad they happened because I wouldn’t have learned all these lessons. My personality hasn’t changed; I’m still a carefree girl.</p>
