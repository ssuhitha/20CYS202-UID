<p> <em>The group has three main rappers and four main vocals,<em>BTS</em> consists of seven members first up is <em>Kim Namjoon</em> he is a rapper and the leader of the group. I love his <em>ddaeng<em> rap so much
.Next is <em>Kim Seokjin</em>  he is a vocalist and a visual for the group. I love his recent song called <em>astronut<em> which is written for his army.Then we have <em>Min Yoongi</em> he is the lead rapper for the group. I love <em>augustd album<em> which is produced by him.<em>Jung Hoseok he raps and is the main dancer for the group, recently he released a new album <em>Jack in the box</em> which i really love.

 then we have Kim Taehyung he is a vocalist he is a visual for the group as well as a lead dancer, he is my most loved singer he has the healing voice, <em>his every solo is my favorite</em>

 lastly, we have Jeon Jungkook he is the main vocalist and a lead dancer for the group.He is the my most favorite singer. I in love with his vocals.</em>

 

<h3>Why i like them so much?</h3>

<em>They worked really hard on their music and their songs have a lot of meaning .They come from literally nothing they worked hard to be where they are right now.


<i>They pursued what they wanted to do....</i>

Kim Seokjin gambled his education to be what he wanted to be a singer.
 
Park Jimin who thought he cannot do it but worked hard after hours to improve himself. 

Jung Hoseok who seemed to always smile and make others laugh never felt like an accomplishment. 

Kim Taehyung was always a part of BTS but never revealed until his debut.

Kim Seokjin was supposed to act started with zero knowledge of singing but here he is now.

Jeon Jungkook started auditioning company full company until he stopped at BigHit Entertainment. 

These seven men have worked hard taken all the risks and proved to music world that they aren't a joke.

<br><h2>Conclusion</h2>

BTS is an inspiration for me .
 

<i>We stan kingsðŸ’œâœ¨</i>
